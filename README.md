## Inspiration üåé
One of the challenges in our multicultural country is providing healthcare to non-verbal or non-English speaking patients.

Health care professionals often face a challenge when communicating with these patients. Bedside workers are not provided a translator and often rely on the patient's family for communication. This leads to miscommunication with the patient and misinformation from the family that may not be entirely truthful when answering questions involving medical history.

This also creates a problem when the nurses are trying to fully inform their patients before receiving their consent for a treatment. Nurses are liable is they don't received informed consent and communicating with non-verbal or non-English speaking patients can become increasing stressful for this reason.

Our team wanted address all of these problems while improving the efficiency and quality of life for these hard working, under staffed professionals.

## What does it do ü§î
Our application provides a system to help healthcare workers communicate with non-verbal and non-English speaking patients in a user friendly manner using real-time transcription and translating, graphical pain indicators, and visual symptom assessment surveys.

## How we built it üî®
Using AssemblyAI + Google Translate API we created a real-time transcription and translating system that can cross the language barrier between the patient and the healthcare worker.

Interactive healthcare diagrams made using HTML and JavaScript designed to be simple and user-friendly were constructed to help patients visually communicate with professionals quickly.

All of the data is stored for later use in a secure hospital database to help keep track of patients' progress and make for easy data sharing between shifts of nurses.

## Challenges we ran into üîé
Configuring the translations API and incorporating it into a browser environment proved to be very difficult when developing the backend. After hours of reading documentation, consulting mentors, and trying different approaches we finally got these tools to work seamlessly for our subtitle generator.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üí™
We were able to implement real-time captioning using AssemblyAI and translation using the Google Translate API. We are also proud that we made a fully functioning web application in only 36 hours without the use of a framework. We think our program can provide real benefits to the healthcare industry.

## What we learned üß†
We all learned how to use AssemblyAI and some of us learned JavaScript for the first time. We got to build on our UI development skills and refine our knowledge of databases.

## Looking Forward ‚è©
We plan to implement foreign to English language translation to improve communication between the patient and nurse. With more time, we would have added functionality for nurses to customize the symptoms questionnaire and patient needs menu to further improve user experience.
